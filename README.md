# Validated Form
Hi! I'm Ramiro and this is a one page website. Its objective is just to make form validations with JavaScript and regular expressions. Of course, I want it to look pretty aesthetic, so I used a lot of animations.

As I said before (and in the website footer), this is a trial form, so it's not real and (at least for now) any submitted information will not be received anywhere. Anyway, I still recommend no to complete with real or sensitive information if you try it.

I hope you all like it! ;)
